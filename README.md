# 📊 CrowdPulse | Crowdfunding Insights (Tableau)

**One dataset. One logic. Maximum interactivity.**

An interactive Tableau analysis of global crowdfunding campaigns (2009–2019), designed to explore **success patterns, funding behavior, and category performance** through **filter-driven dashboards** instead of static visuals.

## Why this project
Crowdfunding analysis often stops at counts and totals.  
This project focuses on **how goals, categories, and timing influence success**, allowing users to **slice the same KPIs dynamically** across countries, years, and months.

> Most visuals are fully interactive and controlled through **dashboard-level filters and actions**, not separate slicer sheets.
